Hello,

Today I have worked on following things : 

- I have created 2 pages along with the code for showing the data from both the apis for single property and property listing as well.

- About the property list, I have tried that thing to get name and other details by api call at each property listing on home page. But I had to skipp that thing because it took more than a minute just to get the data. So now, we will be only showing reference id there along with the pagination.

- Those 2 pages are not that much UI currently but i will be working on it.

- I have created the new repo for this proj and here is the link with today's code commited. Link :
